[DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description) is a European specification of how to describe public sector datasets. Open Meal has [one DCAT-AP file](/Open-Meal/datasets/dcat) to describe the central parts of the specification (i.e. List Data Providers) and one per Data Provider to describe their implementation of Open Meal.

##Data Providers
An example of a DCAT-AP file for Data Providers is available at [dataprovider-dcat-ap-example.rdf](/Open-Meal/dataprovider-dcat-ap-example.rdf)

Please change all URLs, email addresses and mentions of *Data Provider* into the relevant information.
